homework for april 11th


This is my (very late) homework for 4/11. I worked with Guillermo and Zach on this project, thus why you may have seen this code before.  We used moment.js to allow for a day schedule display. This allows for the user to enter 'to-do' items, and save them to local storage. The current hour will be represented by a different color container.
